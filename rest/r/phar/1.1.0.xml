 <s>allows running of complete applications out of .phar files (like Java .jar files)</s>
 <d>This is the extension version of PEAR's PHP_Archive package. Support for
zlib, bz2 and crc32 is achieved without any dependency other than the external
zlib or bz2 extension.

.phar files can be read using the phar stream, or with the Phar class.  If the SPL extension
is available, a Phar object can be used as an array to iterate over a phar's contents
or to read files directly from the phar.

Phar archives can be created using the streams API or with the Phar class, if
the phar.readonly ini variable is set to false.

Full support for MD5 and SHA1 signatures is possible. Signatures can be required 
if the ini variable phar.require_hash is set to true. When PECL extension hash is
avaiable then SHA-256 and SHA-512 signatures are supported as well.</d>

 <n>* implement ability connect a phar file 'phar://whatever' to a directory. That way all
  access to that phar archive are directed to the extracted directory. This
  allows to have the installed files and the archieve keep the same includes.

* implement SHA-2 (256, 512) support [Marcus]
* implement setSignatureAlgorithm() and Phar::MD5 Phar::SHA1 Phar::SHA256 Phar::SHA512 Phar::PGP to
  choose the kind of signature to use (PGP falls back to SHA1) [Greg]</n>
