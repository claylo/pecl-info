 <n>Runkit7 3.0 finishes changing this extension's name from &quot;runkit&quot; to &quot;runkit7&quot;.
THIS WILL REQUIRE CHANGES TO YOUR BUILD SCRIPTS AND PHP.INI FILES.
This change was made at the request of PECL admins, to comply with naming and packaging standards.

- The compiled shared object name has been changed from `runkit.so` to `runkit7.so` (Mac/Linux) and `php_runkit.dll` to `php_runkit7.dll` (Windows)
  (php.ini files should be changed to reference `extension=runkit7.so` or `extension=php_runkit7.dll`)
- The configure flag names have been changed from flags such as `--enable-runkit` / `--enable-runkit-modify` to `--enable-runkit7` / `--enable-runkit7-modify`
- Code using `extension_loaded('runkit')` should be changed to `extension_loaded('runkit7')` (as well as uses of ReflectionExtension, etc.)
- The ini options `runkit.superglobal` and `runkit.internal_override` are unaffected.

Changes in 3.0.0
- Update documentation
- Remove RUNKIT_VERSION
- It is now possible to disable superglobal support (--disable-runkit7-super was fixed)
- Classkit compatibility functions/constants have been removed.</n>
