 <s>Extension exposing PHP 7 abstract syntax tree</s>
 <d>php-ast exports the AST internally used by PHP 7.
     php-ast is significantly faster than PHP-Parser, because the AST construction is implemented in C.
     However, php-ast may only parse code that is syntactically valid on the version of PHP it runs on.</d>
