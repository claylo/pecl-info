 <s>Functions to write XML-RPC servers and clients</s>
 <d>These functions can be used to write XML-RPC servers and clients. You can find
  more information about XML-RPC at http://www.xmlrpc.com/, and more documentation
  on this extension and its functions at http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/.

  The extension is unbundled from php-src as of PHP 8.0.0, because the underlying
  libxmlrpc has obviously been abandoned. It is recommended to reevaluate using
  this extension.</d>

 <n>This is the snapshot of ext/xmlrpc just before it was unbundled from php-src.
Only minimal modifications have been made thereafter.</n>
