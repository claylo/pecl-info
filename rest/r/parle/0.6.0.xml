 <s>Parsing and lexing</s>
 <d>With Parle, it is possible to implement lexing and parsing in PHP while relying on features and principles of the parser/lexer generator tools for C/C++.</d>
 <da>2017-09-16 21:51:17</da>
 <n>- Fix consistency of return type in 7.0/7.1/7.2 (Remi Collet)
- Fix memory leak in Parle\Stack
- Max parser id is set to UINT16_MAX to save memory. This might be changed in the future
- Push signatures accepting string range for regex was removed as ZPP would deliver copies anyway
- Turned Lexer methods bol, flags and state into properties
- Turned Parser methods action and reduceId into properties
- Turned Stack methods empty and size into properties</n>
