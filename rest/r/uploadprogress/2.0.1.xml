 <s>An extension to track progress of a file upload.</s>
 <d>A PHP extension to track progress of a file upload, including details on the speed of the upload, estimated time remaining, and access to the contents of the file as it is being uploaded.

        The uploadprogress extension works on PHP 7.2+ and PHP 8. It requires the use of the Apache HTTP Server with mod_php. Other web servers and PHP-FPM are not yet supported.
