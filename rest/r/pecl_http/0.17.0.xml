 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>* Building absolute URLs
* RFC compliant HTTP redirects
* RFC compliant HTTP date handling
* Parsing of HTTP headers and messages
* Caching by &quot;Last-Modified&quot; and/or ETag
  (with 'on the fly' option for ETag generation from buffered output)
* Sending data/files/streams with (multiple) ranges support
* Negotiating user preferred language/charset
* Convenient request functionality built upon libcurl
* PHP5 classes: HttpUtil, HttpResponse (PHP-5.1), HttpRequest, HttpRequestPool, HttpMessage</d>
 <da>2005-11-04 07:03:02</da>
 <n>+ Added experimental thread safety for builds linking against libcurl-gnutls
+ Improved the chunked decoder
+ Added clone support to HttpRequest objects

- License changed from PHP license to revised BSD license!
- HttpMessage properties are not accessible by reference or array index/key!
- HttpRequest history logging is disabled by default!
- HttpRequestPool is not clonable!

* Fixed a bug where HttpRequest warnings were hidden within the HttpRequestPool
* Fixed shared build within the PHP source tree
* Fixed parallel build with ext/zlib on Win32
* Fixed object deallocation
* Fixed http_support() pretending no support for SSL in non-threadsafe builds
* Fixed the message parser to not choke on headers containing HTTP/1.x
* Fixed access to protected HttpMessage properties in extending classes
* Fixed lots of tests for the changed HTTP header order in PHP-5.1</n>
