 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful 
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, headers and messages, provides 
means for negotiation of a client's preferred content type, 
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any 
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality with support for
parallel requests.
