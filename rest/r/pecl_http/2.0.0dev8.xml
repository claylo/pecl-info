 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported;
  Nevertheless, you have to use the http\Request\Factory to create your request/pool/datashare objects.</d>
 <da>2012-03-16 11:15:06</da>
 <n>* Fixed build failure and compiler warnings
* Fixed logical errors in http\Env\Response::isCachedBy{Etag,LastModified}()
* Fixed memory leaks in http\Env\Response::isCachedByLastModified()
* Fixed memory leaks in http\Env::getResponseHeader()
* Fixed erroneous trailing CRLF of http\Message strings
- Renamed http\Message\Body::add() to ::addForm()
+ Added http\Message\Body::addPart(http\Message $part)
+ Added http\Env\Response::__invoke() output buffering handler</n>
