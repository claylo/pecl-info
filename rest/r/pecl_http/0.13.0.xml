 <s>Extended HTTP support</s>
 <d>* Building absolute URIs
* RFC compliant HTTP redirects
* RFC compliant HTTP date handling
* Parsing of HTTP headers and messages
* Caching by &quot;Last-Modified&quot; and/or ETag
  (with 'on the fly' option for ETag generation from buffered output)
* Sending data/files/streams with (multiple) ranges support
* Negotiating user preferred language/charset
* Convenient request functionality built upon libcurl
* PHP5 classes: HttpUtil, HttpResponse (PHP-5.1), HttpRequest, HttpRequestPool, HttpMessage
 
</d>
 <da>2005-09-09 10:53:57</da>
 <n>+ HTTP request method API is now available for builds without libcurl, too
+ Added HttpResponse::guessContentType() through libmagic

- Removed HttpResponse class from PHP-5.0 (WONKY) due to ZE limitations

* Improved the build system
* Imrpoved logging format
* Implemented SSL crypto locks for thread safe builds
* Fixed ridiculous low default transfer timeout of 3 seconds (set to 0 now)
* Fixed a bug where plain instead of more specific HttpExceptions were thrown
* Fixed a bug where entities that where not marked for being cached were
  actually cached if an apropriate ETag or Last-Modified header was seen</n>
