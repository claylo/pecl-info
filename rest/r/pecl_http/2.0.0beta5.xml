 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful 
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, headers and messages, provides 
means for negotiation of a client's preferred content type, 
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any 
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality, if built with CURL 
support. Parallel requests are available for PHP 5 and greater.</d>

 <n>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported.</n>
