 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, headers and messages, provides
means for negotiation of a client's preferred content type,
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality with support for
parallel requests.

 <n>&gt; *NOTE:*  
  v4.x is PHP-8 only.

* PHP 8 compatibility
  - Drop ext-propro support
    PHP 8 removes the object get/set API from the ZendEngine, which renders
    that extension dysfunctional. As a consequence, the header property of
    http\Message and derived classes cannot be modified in place, and thus
    by reference.

Changes from beta1:
* Fixed configure on systems which do not provide icu-config
* Fixed gh-issue #89: Cookie handling cannot be disabled since v3.2.1</n>
