 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported;
  Nevertheless, you have to use the http\Request\Factory to create your request/pool/datashare objects.</d>

 <n>* Improved test coverage [1] and fixed a lot of issues with the cookie, params, querystring,
  persistent handles, request factory, etag, stream filters, encoding streams, negotiation
  and HTTP message info code.
