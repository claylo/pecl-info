 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again.</d>
 <da>2012-01-16 10:23:05</da>
 <n>This is to become v2 of the known pecl_http extension.
It is completely incompatible to previous version.
Try it, or let it be. If you are not sure, let it be. Really.

List of changes (TBD):
* Everything lives below the http namespace
* The message body is implemented as a temp stream instead of a chunk of memory
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented in the http\env namespace
* There's only http\Exception
* Every instance follows http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling, but only for errors generated by the extension itself
* You have to use the http\Request\Factory to create your requests/pools/datashares</n>
