 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful 
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, dates, redirects, headers and 
messages, provides means for negotiation of clients preferred 
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any 
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality, if built with CURL 
support. Parallel requests are available for PHP-5 and greater.

PHP-5 classes:
HttpUtil, HttpMessage, HttpRequest, HttpRequestPool; HttpResponse (PHP-5.1)</d>
 <da>2005-12-15 09:31:04</da>
 <n>! Request functionality requires libcurl &gt;= 7.12.3 now

+ Added 'bodyonly' request option
+ Added IOCTL callback for cURL
+ Added ssl_engines array and cookies array to the request info array
+ Added http_parse_cookie() to parse Set-Cookie headers

- Renamed http_connectcode to connect_code in the request info array
- Enable &quot;original headers&quot; previously stripped off by the message parser:
	o X-Original-Transfer-Encoding (Transfer-Encoding)
	o X-Original-Content-Encoding (Content-Encoding)
	o X-Original-Content-Length (Content-Length)
- RequestExceptions thrown by HttpRequestPool::__construct() and send() are
  now wrapped into the HttpRequestPoolException object's $exceptionStack property
- Removed http_compress() and http_uncompress() (http_deflate/inflate ambiguity)

* Fixed bug which caused GZIP encoded archives to be decoded
* Fixed bug with DEFLATE encoded response messages
* Fixed several memory leaks and inconspicuous access violations
* Fixed some logical errors in the uri builder</n>
