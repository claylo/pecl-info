 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful 
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, dates, redirects, headers and 
messages, provides means for negotiation of clients preferred 
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any 
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

support. Parallel requests are available for PHP-5 and greater.

PHP-5 classes:
HttpUtil, HttpMessage, HttpRequest, HttpRequestPool, 
HttpDeflateStream, HttpInflateStream
