 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported.</d>

 <n>! &gt;80% test coverage http://goo.gl/VmyIW
* Fixed build with libcurl &lt;= 7.21.3
* Fixed var_dump of http\Message with inherited userland properties with increased access level
+ Added http\Header::getParams()
+ Added simple support for escapes and quotes in the params parser
+ Added support for sending http\Env\Response over PHP streams
+ Added message body reference counting</n>
