 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported.</d>

 <n>! &gt;80% test coverage
* Fixed http\Request\Pool with libevent2
* Fixed http\Env\Request::getFiles() with multiple-file-uploads
* Fixed PHP-5.3 compatibility
* Fixed reference handling of http\Message\Body::getResource()
* Fixed reading stream filters to correctly detect EOF of tmp and mem streams
- Change: merge message headers with the same key
- Change: the stream message parser can optionally return after each message
- Change: you have to care yourself for Content headers if a message's body has a reading stream filter attached
+ Added http\Env::getResponseStatusForAllCodes()</n>
