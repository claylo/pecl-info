 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>Extended HTTP support. Again. Keep in mind that it's got the major version 2, because it's incompatible with pecl_http v1.

* Introduces the http namespace.
* Message bodies have been remodeled to use PHP temporary streams instead of in-memory buffers.
* The utterly misunderstood HttpResponse class has been reimplemented as http\Env\Response inheriting http\Message.
* Currently, there's only one Exception class left, http\Exception.
* Errors triggered by the extension can be configured statically by http\Object::$defaultErrorHandling or inherited http\Object-&gt;errorHandling.
* The request ecosystem has been modularized to support different libraries, though for the moment only libcurl is supported;
  Nevertheless, you have to use the http\Request\Factory to create your request/pool/datashare objects.</d>

 <n>+ Added population of $_POST and $_FILES for non-POST requests
- Renamed http\Env\Request::getPost() to ::getForm()
- Changed http\Env\Response::setContentDisposition() to take an http\Params like array as argument
- Removed http\Env\Response::CONTENT_DISPOSOTION_* constants
- Removed http\Request\Method class; request methods are now used as simple strings</n>
