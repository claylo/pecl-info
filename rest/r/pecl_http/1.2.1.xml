 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful 
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, dates, redirects, headers and 
messages, provides means for negotiation of clients preferred 
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any 
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality, if built with CURL 
support. Parallel requests are available for PHP 5 and greater.</d>

 <n>+ Added HttpException::__toString() which takes care about any inner exceptions
- Disallowed detaching HttpRequest objects from HttpRequestPool while executing progress callback
* Fixed crash on detaching requests from pool in request event callbacks
* Fixed suppression of nested exceptions in e.g. HttpRequestPool::send() (fixes bug #8535)
* Fixed issues with inheritance and cloning of HttpDeflateStream, HttpInflateStream and HttpMessage
  (Extending classes lose default properties on instantiation; Complex members ignored during cloning)</n>
