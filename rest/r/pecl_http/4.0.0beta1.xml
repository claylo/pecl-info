 <s>Extended HTTP Support</s>
 <d>This HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful
set of functionality for one of PHPs major applications.

It eases handling of HTTP urls, headers and messages, provides
means for negotiation of a client's preferred content type,
language and charset, as well as a convenient way to send any
arbitrary data with caching and resuming capabilities.

It provides powerful request functionality with support for
parallel requests.

 <n>&gt;*NOTE:*
v4.x will be PHP-8 only, v3.x continues PHP-7 support

* PHP 8 compatibility
  - Drop ext-propro support
    PHP 8 removes the object get/set API from the ZendEngine, which renders
    that extension dysfunctional. As a consequence, the header property of
    http\Message and derived classes cannot be modified in place, and thus
    by reference.</n>
