 <s>APM and distributed tracing for PHP</s>
 <d>The Datadog PHP Tracer brings APM and distributed tracing to PHP.</d>
 <da>2020-08-25 23:10:26</da>
 <n>## Important!
The legacy API for custom instrumentation `dd_trace()` is now a no-op in this release. See the [upgrade guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/custom_instrumentation/php/?tab=tracingfunctioncalls#legacy-api-upgrade-guide) for instructions on upgrading.

The way PHP 5.4 and 5.6 hook into the engine has changed. Please read [deep call stacks on PHP 5](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/troubleshooting/php_5_deep_call_stacks/) for more information on potential issues.

All calls to `DDTrace\trace_function` or `DDTrace\trace_method` functions need to happen before the first invocation of the target e.g. `DDTrace\trace_function('foo', ...)` should be done before `foo` is called for the first time. In the future this may need to be done before the target is even defined. This was previously noted in 0.45.0, but is now enforced for all PHP versions.
