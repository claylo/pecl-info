 <s>APM and distributed tracing for PHP</s>
 <d>The Datadog PHP Tracer brings APM and distributed tracing to PHP.</d>
 <da>2024-02-20 10:42:26</da>
 <n>### Fixes across all extensions
- Handle Apache graceful restarts more accurately #2483
- Mark config as immutable and interned to avoid refcounting race conditions #2516

## Tracer
This release includes Windows dlls for the tracer starting with PHP 7.2. #2230

Windows support is in beta. We recommend carefully deploying the tracer to staging environments and testing it there before putting it to production. We are looking towards stabilizing Windows quickly, so any feedback and issue reports are welcome.

### Added
- Enhance logging #2490
  - This features two new logging options:
    - `datadog.trace.log_level` allows more fine-grained control over logging (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`). It follows the RUST_LOG standard. Note that `datadog.trace.debug` still takes precedence if set.
    - `datadog.trace.log_file` allows specifying a dedicated target file for any datadog trace logs instead of the default php error location.
  - More log lines were added to allow for observing submitted spans (debug level) and hook invocations (trace level).
- Add http.route to Wordpress #2491

### Changed
- Have datadog.trace.db_client_split_by_instance also affect mysqli and sqlsrv #2508
- Record nested exceptions in the integrations #2514
- Evaluate numbers and bools in tags and metrics for sampling rules #2521

### Fixed
- Access to undefined method `attempts` in LaravelQueueIntegration #2485
- Include generated curl_exec spans of curl_multi_exec() in metrics #2505
- Remove Symfony Command Hook After Execution #2492
- Add zend_try around closing and flushing spans #2507
- Make PDO split-by coherent with other DB split-by with service name flattening #2524

### Internal
- No longer compile the mockgen as part of the rust build #2512
- Add TEA Benchmarks #2438
- Reduce CI and Local Flakiness #2496, #2518

## Profiling
This release requires System INIs to be used to configure the profiler settings which control the enabling/disabling of individual features. If you are configuring the profiler using `php datadog-setup.php config set`, you should be fine. We recommend switching to use the [config mode of datadog-setup.php](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/enabling/php/?tab=gnuclinux#installation) to configure profiling.

### Added
- Enable timeline by default #2480. This can be disabled by setting the INI setting datadog.profiling.timeline_enabled to 0 or false. Using the datadog-setup.php script is recommended, for example:

    php datadog-setup.php config set --php-bin all -ddatadog.profiling.timeline_enabled=0
- PHP ZTS support for CPU- and Wall Time profiling #2470
- Add exception message to exception sample (opt-in) #2434

### Changed
- Breaking-change: require system INIs for profiling features #2468

### Internal
- Update dependencies and pin `ahash` #2479
- Fix clippy::single-match #2482
- Update to libdatadog 6 #2513
- Refactor: use SystemSettings in locals #2487
- Fix accidentally skipped tests #2517

## Application Security Management
This release introduces support for the Roadrunner application server and extends threat detection and blocking on XML and JSON request payloads. Request and response payloads are now also used to expand the already existing API security features.

### Added
- Roadrunner appsec support #2443
- Provide server.response.body #2489
- Support json/xml request bodies #2499

### Changed
- Change ip header parsing/header reporting #2503

### Fixed
- Fix blocking on PHP 7.0-7.1 ZTS #2502
- Ensure logs are committed to disk upon shutdown #2495 

### Internal
- Upgrade libddwaf and ruleset #2520</n>
