 <s>Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server (PDO_SQLSRV)</s>
 <d>The Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server are PHP extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PDO for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2008 R2 and later (including Azure SQL DB). These drivers rely on the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.
*This package contains only the PDO_SQLSRV driver.*</d>

 <n>[Fixed]
- PDO::quote with string containing ASCII NUL character (Issue [#538]( https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/538))
- Appropriate error message is returned when calling nextRowset() or sqlsrv_next_result() on an empty result set (issue [#507 ](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/507))
- Decimal types with no decimals are correctly handled when AE is enabled (PR [#544](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/pull/544))
- Search for installed ODBC drivers in Linux/macOS first before attempting to connect using the default ODBC driver 
- BIGINT as an output param no longer results in value out of range exception when the returned value is larger than a maximum integer ([PR #567](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/pull/567))
[Limitations]
- Always Encrypted functionalities are only supported using [MSODBC 17 preview](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/tree/dev/ODBC%2017%20binaries%20preview)
  - ODBC binaries for macOS available upon request
- MSODBC 17 preview msodbcsql.msi only works for Windows10
- [Always Encrypted limitations](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Features#aelimitation)
- When using sqlsrv_query with Always Encrypted feature, SQL type has to be specified for each input (see [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Features#aebindparam))
- No support for inout / output params when using sql_variant type
[Known Issues]
- Connection pooling on Linux doesn't work properly when using the MSODBC17 preview
- When pooling is enabled in Linux or MAC
  - unixODBC &lt;= 2.3.4 (Linux and MAC) might not return proper diagnostics information, such as error messages, warnings and informative messages
  - due to this unixODBC bug, fetch large data (such as xml, binary) as streams as a workaround. See the examples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Connection-Pooling-on-Linux-and-Mac)</n>
