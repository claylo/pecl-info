 <s>Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server (PDO_SQLSRV)</s>
 <d>The Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server are PHP extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PDO for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2008 R2 and later (including Azure SQL DB). These drivers rely on the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.
*This package contains only the PDO_SQLSRV driver.*</d>

 <n>[Added]
- Added support for Azure Key Vault for Always Encrypted functionality. Always Encrypted functionality is supported on Linux and macOS through Azure Key Vault
- Added support for connection resiliency on Linux and macOS (requires version 17.2 or higher of the [ODBC driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017))
- Added support for macOS High Sierra (requires version 17 or higher of the [ODBC driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017))
- Added support for Ubuntu 18.04 (requires version 17.2 or higher of the [ODBC driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017))
[Fixed]
- Issue [#577](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/577) - Idle Connection Resiliency doesn't work with Column Encryption enabled connections (fixed in MS ODBC Driver 17.1)
- Issue [#678](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/678) - Idle Connection Resiliency doesn't work with Connection Pooling (fixed in MS ODBC Driver 17.1)
- Issue [#705](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/705) - Always Encrypted - Retrieving a negative decimal value (edge case) as output parameter causes truncation
- Issue [#706](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/706) - Always Encrypted - Cannot insert double with precision and scale (38, 38)
- Issue [#707](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/707) - Always Encrypted - Fetching decimals / numerics as output parameters bound to PDO::PARAM_BOOL or PDO::PARAM_INT returns floats, not integers 
- Issue [#735](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/735) - Extended the buffer size for PDO::lastInsertId so that data types other than integers can be supported
- Pull Request [#759](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/pull/759) - Removed the limitation of binding a binary as inout param as PDO::PARAM_STR with SQLSRV_ENCODING_BINARY
[Limitations]
- No support for inout / output params when using sql_variant type
- In Linux and macOS, setlocale() only takes effect if it is invoked before the first connection. Attempting to set the locale after connecting will not work
- Always Encrypted requires [MS ODBC Driver 17+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017)
  - Only Windows Certificate Store and Azure Key Vault are supported. Custom Keystores are not yet supported
  - Issue [#716](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/716) - With Always Encrypted enabled, named parameters in subqueries are not supported
  - [Always Encrypted limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/using-always-encrypted-php-drivers?view=sql-server-2017#limitations-of-the-php-drivers-when-using-always-encrypted)
[Known Issues]
- Connection pooling on Linux or macOS is not recommended with [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/) &lt; 2.3.6
- When pooling is enabled in Linux or macOS
  - unixODBC &lt;= 2.3.4 (Linux and macOS) might not return proper diagnostic information, such as error messages, warnings and informative messages
  - due to this unixODBC bug, fetch large data (such as xml, binary) as streams as a workaround. See the examples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Features#pooling)
- With ColumnEncryption enabled, calling stored procedure with XML parameter does not work (Issue [#674](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/674))</n>
