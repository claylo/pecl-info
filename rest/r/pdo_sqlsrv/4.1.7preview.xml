 <s>Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server (PDO_SQLSRV)</s>
 <d>The Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server are PHP extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PDO for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2005 and later (including Azure SQL DB). These drivers rely on the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.
*This package contains only the PDO_SQLSRV driver.*</d>

 <n>[Added]
- The early technical preview (ETP) with basic functionalities is now available on MAC OS X. Tested on OS versions El Capitan (OS X 10.11) 
[Fixed]
- Fixed null returned when an empty string is set to an output parameter (issue #308)
- Fixed memory leaks in buffered result sets
- Fixed wrong value returned when fetching varbinary value on Linux (issue #270)
- Fixed clang compile errors
- Fixed binary data not returned when the column is bound by name (issue #35)
- Fixed exception thrown on closeCursor() when the statement has not been executed (issue #267)
[Known Issues]
- User defined data types and SQL_VARIANT
- Binary column binding with emulate prepare (issue #140)
- In MAC OS X, if loading both sqlsrv and pdo_sqlsrv, the order matters (even when dynamically). For PDO scripts, load pdo_sqlsrv.so first
- Segmentation fault may result when an unsupported attribute is used for connection
- Connection pooling not working in MAC OS X</n>
