 <s>Event Scheduling Engine</s>
 <d>This is an extension to efficiently schedule IO, time and signal based
events using the best available IO notification mechanism for your system.
This is a port of libevent to the PHP infrastructure; the API is similar
but not identical.

 <n>Added event_timeout() function for easily scheduling a callback after a certain
period of time.  The timeout may be persistent to make the callback a recurrent
event.

Fixed an issue with timercmp() on windows that caused a busy wait when the
scheduler could have performed a sleep.

Windows scheduling engine now also processes the message queue while waiting;
useful for COM/GUI based scripts.

Fixed build for threaded systems with real signals.

Supports epoll(4), poll(2) and select(2) IO notification engines.
Support for /dev/poll and kqueue is pending.

On Windows, currently only sockets can participate in the IO notification engine.</n>
