 <n>Fixed some memory issues in PHP7
- SSL leaks
- Possibility of implicit destruction of user vars
- Unclean SSL bufferevent shutdown
- EventBufferEvent::free() within a callback damaged zvals bound to corresponding bufferevent thereby causing SEGFAULT

Fixed PHP5/PHP7 memory issue: string returned by EventBuffer::pullup() was not zero-terminated</n>
