 <s>Varnish Cache bindings</s>
 <d>Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator. The extension makes it possible to interact with a running varnish instance through TCP socket or shared memory.</d>

 <n>- VarnishAdmin
	* VarnishAdmin:ban() bases on the vcl ban commando
	* VarnishAdmin::banUrl() bases on the vcl ban.url commando
	* Arguments are passed to the varnish as given, which is probably a better idea than parsing
                	them on the php side one more time. The return status value can be used to check if the command
	was successful.
	* improved VarnishAdmin::isRunning()
- added VarnishLog class
	* VarnishLog::getLine()
	* VarnishLog::getTagName()
	* Varnish log tag list
	* Can now read log records from a running varnishd SHM. Not sure, whether more functionality would be sensible, as it requires to run as daemon.</n>
