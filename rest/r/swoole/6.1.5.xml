 <d>Event-driven asynchronous and concurrent networking engine with high performance for PHP.
        - event-driven
        - coroutine
        - asynchronous non-blocking
        - multi-thread reactor
        - multi-process worker
        - multi-protocol
        - millisecond timer
        - built-in tcp/http/websocket/http2 server
        - coroutine tcp/http/websocket client
        - coroutine read/write file system
        - coroutine dns lookup
        - support IPv4/IPv6/UnixSocket/TCP/UDP

 <n>- Fixed a crash issue when users manually suspend coroutines in a multithreaded environment
- Fixed the issue where the `System::socket_poll()` function incorrectly closed sockets after failing to add events
- Fixed decompression failure in `WebSocket` when compressing message frames, caused by certain server environments not supporting `MAX_MEM_LEVEL=9`
- Fixed data reception errors in `WebSocket` when receiving consecutive compressed data frames, caused by the buffer not being cleared in time
- Fixed the `data race` issue in the `pdo_oci` coroutine client when processing non-`PDO_PARAM_LOB` data
- In `Http Server`, when developers set the `Content-Encoding` header, `Swoole` will no longer automatically compress the response body. Instead, developers need to implement compression logic themselves and output the corresponding content.
- Removed the `PDO::sqliteCreateAggregate()`, `PDO::sqliteCreateCollation()`, and `PDO::sqliteCreateFunction()` functions in the coroutine environment. Their implementation principle involves calling PHP functions as callbacks in the `sqlite3` engine, which is only feasible in single-threaded synchronous blocking mode. In `Swoole` coroutine mode, the `C` functions of `sqlite3` need to run in asynchronous `AIO` threads. In the `ZTS` version, this can cause null pointer reads, while in the `NTS` version, it may lead to `data race` issues and occasional crashes.
- Removed support for the `open_basedir` setting in the `pdo_sqlite` coroutine client. It is unsafe to read `PG(open_basedir)` in a multithreaded environment. Ensure that the `sqlite3` database file path is a constant or other safe path. Do not use user input parameters as part of the `sqlite` database file path.</n>
