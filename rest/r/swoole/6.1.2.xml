 <d>Event-driven asynchronous and concurrent networking engine with high performance for PHP.
        - event-driven
        - coroutine
        - asynchronous non-blocking
        - multi-thread reactor
        - multi-process worker
        - multi-protocol
        - millisecond timer
        - built-in tcp/http/websocket/http2 server
        - coroutine tcp/http/websocket client
        - coroutine read/write file system
        - coroutine dns lookup
        - support IPv4/IPv6/UnixSocket/TCP/UDP
        - support SSL/TLS encrypted transmission</d>

 <n>- No longer throw warnings when failing to set the `socket` receive/send buffer size
- Fixed an issue in `Swoole\Http\Server` where the `onClose` callback might execute before `onRequest` when handling `HTTP2` requests, leading to a use-after-free problem
- Optimized the `getSocket()` method by duplicating the file descriptor when exporting the `php sockets` resource object, preventing `php sockets` from affecting the `socket` held by `Swoole` upon closure
- Fixed a memory leak issue in `Swoole\Async\Client`
- Fixed an issue where `Swoole\Coroutine\Http\Client` of `IPv6` type could not use `Socks5` proxy
- Synchronized updates to adapt to relevant changes in the `CURL` extension in `PHP 8.4`
- Added the `async.file://` file protocol, which allows enabling coroutine scheduling for specific file operations even when global file coroutine support is disabled</n>
