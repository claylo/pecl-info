 <n>+ Task process supports asynchronous and coroutine
+ Refactor `addListener`, now developers can add new service listeners in any order
+ Support  mixed server of `http`, `http2`, `websocket`, `tcp`
+ Completed coroutine redis client method parameter definition
+ `Co::readFile` supports reading non-disk files
+ Now static_handler supports more file types and skips files with length 0
* Fixed multipart/form-data in some cases parsing errors
* Fixed the dislocation of sendfile data on MacOS
* Fixed bug where SIGRTMIN processing error caused the log file to fail to reopen
* Fixed a bug where redis-client last error value was not cleared and the next request was incorrect
* Fixed a bug about connecting a connected asynchronous redis coredump
* Fixed MySQL client protocol processing parameter binding NULL bug
* Fixed segment fault caused by file hook, closed the include/require coroutine
* Fixed the socket hook construct error
* Fixed the sleep hook
* Fixed a bug that returned an illegal pointer when reading an unset object property
* Fixed the bug that after event_wait, EG(scope) is not restored in PHP70, causing private properties to be inaccessible
* Alpine dependency compatibility optimization
* Cygwin compatibility optimization
* Support log_level to block warning information
* Distinguish 204 response then skip body processing
* The underlying code is cleaned up, all TSRM macros, PHP5 compatible macros and functions are removed, useless stack allocation and multiple pointers are reduced, FASTZPP is re-enabled to improve parameter parsing performance
* Error tips optimization, error reporting guidelines will be generated when the underlying crash occurs</n>
