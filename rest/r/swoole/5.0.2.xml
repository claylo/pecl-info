 <d>Event-driven asynchronous and concurrent networking engine with high performance for PHP.
        - event-driven
        - coroutine
        - asynchronous non-blocking
        - multi-thread reactor
        - multi-process worker
        - multi-protocol
        - millisecond timer
        - built-in tcp/http/websocket/http2 server
        - coroutine tcp/http/websocket client
        - coroutine mysql client
        - coroutine redis client
        - coroutine read/write file system
        - coroutine dns lookup
        - support IPv4/IPv6/UnixSocket/TCP/UDP
        - support SSL/TLS encrypted transmission</d>

 <n>- Support for configuring http2 default settings
- Support xdebug under 8.1 or higher
- Refactor curl native to support a curl handle with multiple sockets, such as the curl ftp protocol
- Added $who parameter to Process::setPriority/getPriority
- Added Coroutine\Socket::getBoundCid()
- Adjusted the default value of Coroutine\Socket::recvLine/recvWithBuffer $length parameter to 65536
- Refactor cross-coroutine shutdown feature to make memory release safer and solve the crash problem when a fatal error occurs
- Added socket property for Coroutine\Client, Coroutine\Http\Client, Coroutine\Http2\Client, allow direct operation of socket resources
- Support Http\Server to send empty file to http2 client
- Support graceful restart for Coroutine\Http\Server. When server shuting down, the client connection will no longer be forcibly closed, and only stop listening to new requests
- Added pcntl_rfork pcntl_sigwaitinfo to list of unsafe function, will be closed when coroutine container starts
- Refactor Server process manager with base mode, the behavior of shutdown and reload will be consistent with base or process mode</n>
