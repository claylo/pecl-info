 <n>- Added `non-blocking, reentrant coroutine mutex lock`, which can be used between processes/threads without blocking them. @NathanFreeman
- `Swoole\Coroutine\Socket::getoption()` supports the `TCPINFO` feature. @matyhtf
- `Swoole\Client` synchronous blocking client supports `http` proxy. @matyhtf
- Added asynchronous non-blocking `TCP/UDP/Unix socket` client `Swoole\Async\client`. @matyhtf
- Optimized the `Swoole\Redis\Server::format()` method to support zero-copy memory, compatible with the `Redis` protocol. @matyhtf
- Fixed `Fatal error` issue caused by `PHP-8.4`&#039;s `timeout` feature in ZTS mode. @matyhtf
- Fixed compatibility issue with the `exit()` function in `swoole` for `PHP-8.4`. @remicollet
- Fixed the issue where `Swoole\Thread::getNativeId()` did not work in `cygwin`. @matyhtf
- Fixed the issue causing `SIGSEGV` in `Swoole\Coroutine::getaddrinfo()` method. @matyhtf
- Fixed the issue where the runtime TCP module did not support dynamically enabling SSL encryption. @matyhtf
- Fixed the issue where the HTTP client had an incorrect timeout after running for a long time. @matyhtf
- Fixed the problem where the mutex lock of `Swoole\Table` could not be used before the process exited. @matyhtf
- Fixed the failure of `Swoole\Server::stop()` when using named parameters. @matyhtf
- Fixed the issue with the `toArray` function of concurrent containers in `SWOOLE_THREAD` multi-thread mode. @matyhtf
- Fixed the issue of being unable to delete nested numeric keys in `Swoole\Thread\Map` in `SWOOLE_THREAD` multi-thread mode. @matyhtf
- Multi-thread mode `SWOOLE_THREAD` supports restarting worker threads. @matyhtf
- Multi-thread mode `SWOOLE_THREAD` supports starting timers in the `Manager` thread. @matyhtf
- Compatible with the `curl` extension of `PHP-8.4`. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman
- Refactored `iouring`. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman
- Optimized timers so that synchronous processes do not depend on signals. @matyhtf
- Optimized the `Swoole\Coroutine\System::waitSignal()` method to allow listening to multiple signals simultaneously. @matyhtf
- This version is a `pre-release` and should not be used in production environments, only in testing environments.</n>
