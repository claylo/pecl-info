 <n>- Added multi-threading support, require the ZTS version of PHP. Add `--enable-swoole-thread` option to the configure command to activate it.
- Added a new thread class `Swoole\Thread`. @matyhtf
- Introduced thread lock `Swoole\Thread\Lock`. @matyhtf
- Added thread atomic counter `Swoole\Thread\Atomic`, `Swoole\Thread\Atomic\Long`. @matyhtf
- Added safe concurrent containers `Swoole\Thread\Map`, `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList`, `Swoole\Thread\Queue`. @matyhtf
- The file asynchronous operation supports using `io_uring` as the underlying engine for file asynchronous operations. When liburing is installed and Swoole is compiled with the --enable-iouring option, the asynchronous operations of functions such as file_get_contents, file_put_contents, fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, mkdir, unlink, fsync, fdatasync, rename, fstat, lstat, and filesize will be implemented by io_uring. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman
- Upgraded `Boost Context` to version 1.84. Now, Loongson CPUs can also support coroutines. @NathanFreeman
- Added `Swoole\Thread\Map::find()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList::find()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList::offsetUnset()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Process::getAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setName()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::getAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setPriority()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::getPriority()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::gettid()` method.
- The file asynchronous engine `iouring` supports multi-threaded polling mode `IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL`. @NathanFreeman
- Added `iouring_workers` to modify the number of `iouring` threads. @NathanFreeman
- Added `iouring_flags` to support modifying the `iouring` working mode. @NathanFreeman
- Added `Swoole\Thread\Barrier` for multi-thread synchronization barrier. @matyhtf
- Added new function and class to set cookies. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman

- Fixed the issue where installation via `pecl` was not possible. @remicollet
- Fixed the bug where setting `keepalive` was not possible for `Swoole\Coroutine\FastCGI\Client`. @NathanFreeman

- Fixed the error thrown by zend_fetch_resource2_ex when `STDOUT/STDERR` are already closed. @Appla @matyhtf
- Fixed ineffective `set_tcp_nodelay` configuration. @matyhtf
- Fixed the occasional unreachable branch issue during file upload. @NathanFreeman
- Fixed the problem where setting `dispatch_func` would cause PHP&#039;s internals to throw errors. @NathanFreeman
- Fixed the deprecation of AC_PROG_CC_C99 in autoconf &gt;= 2.70. @petk
- Capture exceptions when thread creation fails. @matyhtf
- Fixed the undefined problem with `_tsrm_ls_cache`. @jingjingxyk
- Fixed the fatal compile error with `GCC 14`. @remicollet
- Fixed the dynamic property issue in `Swoole\Http2\Request`. @guandeng

- Fixed the issue of 503 errors due to not resetting related parameters during process restart. @matyhtf
- Fixed the inconsistency between `$request-&gt;server[&#039;request_method&#039;]` and `$request-&gt;getMethod()` when `HTTP2` is enabled. @matyhtf
- Fixed incorrect `content-type` when uploading files. @matyhtf
