 <n>- Support for PHP versions older than 8 has been dropped. Maintaining compatibility
  with multiple PHP versions (5, 7, and 8) has become increasingly difficult.
  Recent changes in PHP 8.3 have further complicated the build scripts. Additionally,
  as PHP releases older than 8.1 are now officially unsupported, it has become
  challenging to continue supporting PHP 5 and 7.
- Fixed #51: Building statically with PHP 8.3.10 fails with an &quot;unknown&quot; PHP version.</n>
