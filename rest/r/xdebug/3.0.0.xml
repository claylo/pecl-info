 <s>Provides functions for function traces and profiling</s>
 <d>The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * code coverage analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client</d>

 <n>Wed, Nov 25, 2020 - xdebug 3.0.0

Xdebug 3 includes major changes in functionality compared to Xdebug 2. The
primary way how you turn on functionality is through the new xdebug.mode PHP
configuration setting. This made it possible to massively increase performance
in many of Xdebug's sub systems as Xdebug is now much more conservative in
which hooks are enabled.

Configuration changes, massive performance improvements, and PHP 8 support are
the primary features in Xdebug 3, but there is much more. The upgrade guide
lists the changes in great detail, please read it:
