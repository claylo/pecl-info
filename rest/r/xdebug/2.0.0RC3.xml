 <s>Provides functions for function traces and profiling</s>
 <d>The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * script execution analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client</d>

 <n>Wed, Jan 31, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0rc3
+ Changes:
	- Removed the bogus &quot;xdebug.allowed_clients&quot; setting - it was not
	  implemented.
	- Optimized used variable collection by switching to a linked list instead
	  of a hash. This is about 30% faster, but it needed a quick conversion to
	  hash in the case the information had to be shown to remove duplicate
	  variable names.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #232: PHP log_errors functionality lost after enabling xdebug
	  error handler when CLI is used.
	- Fixed problems with opening files - the filename could cause double free
	  issues.
	- Fixed memory tracking as memory_limit is always enabled in PHP 5.2.1 and
	  later.
	- Fixed a segfault that occurred when creating printable stack traces and
	  collect_params was turned off.</n>
