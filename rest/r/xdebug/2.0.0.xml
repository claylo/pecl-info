 <s>Provides functions for function traces and profiling</s>
 <d>The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * code coverage analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client</d>

 <n>Wed, Jul 18, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0

+ Changes:
	- Put back the disabling of stack traces - apperently people were relying
	  on this. This brings back xdebug_enable(), xdebug_disable() and
	  xdebug_is_enabled().
	- xdebug.collect_params is no longer a boolean setting. Although it worked
	  fine, phpinfo() showed only just On or Off here.
	- Fixed the Xdebug version of raw_url_encode to not encode : and \. This is
	  not necessary according to the RFCs and it makes debug breakpoints work
	  on Windows.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #291: Tests that use SPL do not skip when SPL is not available.
	- Fixed bug #290: Function calls leak memory.
	- Fixed bug #289: Xdebug terminates connection when eval() is run in the
	  init stage.
	- Fixed bug #284: Step_over on breakpointed line made Xdebug break twice.
	- Fixed bug #283: Xdebug always returns $this with the value of last stack
	  frame.
	- Fixed bug #282: %s is not usable for xdebug.profiler_output_name on
	  Windows in all stack frames.
	- Fixed bug #280: var_dump() doesn't display key of array as expected.
	- Fixed bug #278: Code Coverage Issue.
	- Fixed bug #273: Remote debugging: context_get does not return context id.
	- Fixed bug #270: Debugger aborts when PHP's eval() is encountered. 
	- Fixed bug #265: XDebug breaks error_get_last() .
	- Fixed bug #261: Code coverage issues by overloading zend_assign_dim.

+ DBGP:
	- Added support for &quot;breakpoint_languages&quot;.</n>
