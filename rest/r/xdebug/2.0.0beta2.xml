 <s>Provides functions for function traces and profiling</s>
 <d>The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * script execution analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client

 <n>+ Added new features:
	- DBGP: Added error messages to returned errors (in most cases)
  
+ Added new functions:
	- Added a function &quot;xdebug_debug_zval&quot; to debug zvals by printing its
	  refcounts and is_ref values.
  
= Changed features:
	- xdebug_code_coverage_stop() will now clean up the code coverage array,
	  unless you specify FALSE as parameter.
	- The proper Xdebug type is &quot;hash&quot; for associative arrays.
	- Extended the code-coverage functionality by returning lines with
	  executable code on them, but where not executed with a count value of -1.

= Fixed bugs:
	- DBGP: Make property_get and property_value finally work as they should,
	  including retrieving information from different depths then the most top
	  stack frame.
	- DBGP: Fix eval'ed $varnames in property_get.
	- DBGP: Support the -d option for property_get.
	- Fixed the exit handler hook to use the new &quot;5.1&quot; way of handling it;
	  which fortunately also works with PHP 5.0.
	- Fixed bug #102: Problems with configure for automake 1.8.
	- Fixed bug #101: crash with set_exeception_handler() and uncatched exceptions.
	- Fixed bug #99: unset variables return the name as a string with property_get.
	- Fixed bug #98: 'longname' attribute not returned for unintialized
	  property in context_get request.
	- Fixed bug #94: xdebug_sprintf misbehaves with x86_64/glibc-2.3.3
	- Fixed bug #93: Crash in lookup_hostname on x86_64
	- Fixed bug #92: xdebug_disable() doesn't disable the exception handler.
	- Fixed bug #68: Summary not written when script ended with &quot;exit()&quot;.</n>
