 <s>Provides functions for function traces and profiling</s>
 <d>The Xdebug extension helps you debugging your script by providing a lot of
valuable debug information. The debug information that Xdebug can provide
includes the following:

    * stack and function traces in error messages with:
          o full parameter display for user defined functions
          o function name, file name and line indications
          o support for member functions
    * memory allocation
    * protection for infinite recursions

Xdebug also provides:

    * profiling information for PHP scripts
    * script execution analysis
    * capabilities to debug your scripts interactively with a debug client</d>

 <n>Wed, May 17, 2007 - xdebug 2.0.0rc4
+ Changes:
	- Use Âµ seconds instead of a tenths of Âµ seconds to avoid confusion in
	  profile information.
	- Changed xdebug.profiler_output_name and xdebug.trace_output_name to use
	  modifier tags:
	  %c = crc32 of the current working directory
	  %p = pid
	  %r = random number
	  %s = script name
	  %t = timestamp (seconds)
	  %u = timestamp (microseconds)
	  %H = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
	  %R = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
	  %S = session_id (from $_COOKIE if set)
	  %% = literal %

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #255: Call Stack Table doesn't show Location on Windows.
	- Fixed bug #251: Using the source command with an invalid filename returns
	  unexpected result.
	- Fixed bug #243: show_exception_trace=&quot;0&quot; ignored.
	- Fixed bug #241: Crash in xdebug_get_function_stack().
	- Fixed bug #240: Crash with xdebug.remote_log on Windows.
	- Fixed a segfault in rendering stack traces to error logs.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented variable names from being recorded for remote
	  debug session while xdebug.collect_vars was turned off.
	- Fixed xdebug_dump_superglobals() in case no super globals were
	  configured.

- Removed functions:
	- Removed support for Memory profiling as that didn't work properly.
	- Get rid of xdebug.default_enable setting and associated functions:
	  xdebug_disable() and xdebug_enable().

+ Added features:
	- Implemented support for four different xdebug.collect_params settings for
	  stack traces and function traces.
	- Allow to trigger profiling by the XDEBUG_PROFILE cookie.

+ DBGP:
	- Correctly add namespace definitions to XML.
	- Added the xdebug namespace that adds extra information to breakpoints if
	  available.
	- Stopped the use of &gt;error&gt; elements for exception breakpoints, as that
	  violates the protocol.</n>
