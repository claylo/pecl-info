 <s>GDChart Based Graphing Interface</s>
 <d>The GDChart extension provides an interface to the bundled
gdchart library. This library uses GD (bundled) library to generate
20 different types of graphs based on supplied parameters.

The extension provides an OO interface to gdchart exposing 
majority of options via properties and complex (array) options via
a series of methods.

To use the current version of the extension PHP 5.0.0 is required,
and older PHP 4 only version can be downloaded from CVS, by checking 
out the extension with PECL_4_3 tag.</d>
