        Supports multi-bytes delimiters, enclosures, and providing a custom EOL sequence.

 <n>Minimum PHP version is now 8.0 due to the usage of new Zend APIs.
All functions have been moved to static methods of a new CSV class.
Function names now refer to &quot;buffer&quot; instead of &quot;file&quot; as a string is used.
CSV::collectionToBuffer() now supports iterable collections, not just arrays.
In case of field number miss-match a ValueError is thrown instead of an Error.
A new CSV::bufferToCollectionLax() has been introduced which doesn't throw a ValueError in case of field number miss-match.
