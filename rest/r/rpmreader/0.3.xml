 <s>RPM file meta information reader</s>
 <d>rpmreader is an extension that provides the ability to
 read RedHat Package Manager (RPM) files' header information.  This
 extension currently does not provide the functionality to read the
 signature or archive sections of the RPM file.</d>
 <da>2005-11-01 15:58:13</da>
 <n>- Added thread safety code to fix rpmreader not compiling with ZTS
  enabled (Bug #5842) (patch provided by adamg at pld-linux dot org).
- Modified minimum PHP requirement in package2.xml to be 4.4.1 instead of
  5.0 since rpmreader has been reported to compile as far back as 4.4.1
  (Bug #5843)
- Updated internal version string to 0.3beta
- Added the rpm_version function to the extension which will return
  the version of rpmreader currently installed</n>
