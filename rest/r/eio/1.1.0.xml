 <s>Provides interface to the libeio library</s>
 <d>This extension provides interface to the libeio library written by Marc Lehmann
    &lt;libeio at schmorp dot de&gt;(see http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libeio.html).

    Libeio is a an asynchronous I/O library. Features basically include
    asynchronous versions of POSIX API(read, write, open, close, stat, unlink,
    fdatasync, mknod, readdir etc.); sendfile (native on Solaris, Linux, HP-UX,
    FreeBSD); readahead. libeio itself emulates the system calls, if they are not
    available on specific(UNIX-like) platform.

    Currently this extension supports Linux platforms only.</d>

 <n>Change: eio_init() deprecated. Will be removed in future. We use pthread_atfork() to re-init eio after a fork
Add: phpt test for the fork support
Fix: tsrm_ls is not initialized in php_eio_init()
Fix: EFD_NONBLOCK and EFD_CLOEXEC used despite the flags were not available until kernel 2.6.7. For the old kernels we call fcntl.
Refact: set FD_CLOEXEC flag for file descriptor opened with eio_open()
Refact: no need to copy zval when passing request resource to eio_grp_*()
Fix: eio_grp_*() didn't initialize eio automatically</n>
