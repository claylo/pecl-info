 <s>Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server (SQLSRV)</s>
 <d>The Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server are PHP extensions that allow for the reading and writing of SQL Server data from within PHP scripts. The SQLSRV extension provides a procedural interface while the PDO_SQLSRV extension implements PDO for accessing data in all editions of SQL Server 2008 R2 and later (including Azure SQL DB). These drivers rely on the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server.
*This package contains only the SQLSRV driver.*</d>

 <n>[Added]
- Added support for Azure Key Vault for Always Encrypted for basic CRUD functionalities such that Always Encrypted feature is also available to Linux or macOS users 
- Added support for macOS High Sierra (requires [MS ODBC Driver 17+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017))
[Fixed]
- Issue [#577](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/577) - Idle Connection Resiliency doesn't work with Column Encryption enabled connection
- Issue [#678](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/678) - Idle Connection Resiliency doesn't work with Connection Pooling bug
- Issue [#699](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/699) - Binding output parameter failed when the query in the stored procedure returned no data. The test case has been added to the test lab.
- Issue [#705](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/705) - AE - Retrieving a negative decimal value (edge case) as output parameter causes truncation
- Issue [#706](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/706) - AE - Cannot insert double with precision and scale (38, 38)
- Pull Request [#759](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/pull/759) - Removed the limitation of binding a binary as inout param as PDO::PARAM_STR with SQLSRV_ENCODING_BINARY
- Pull Request [#775](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/pull/775) - Fixed the problem for output params with SQL types specified as SQLSRV_SQLTYPE_DECIMAL or SQLSRV_SQLTYPE_NUMERIC
[Limitations]
- No support for inout / output params when using sql_variant type
- In Linux and macOS, setlocale() only takes effect if it is invoked before the first connection. The subsequent locale setting will not work
- Always Encrypted feature, which requires [MS ODBC Driver 17+](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017)
  - only Windows Certificate Store and Azure Key Vault are supported
  - Issue [#716](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/716) - With Always Encrypted feature enabled, Named Parameters in Sub Queries are not supported
  - [Always Encrypted limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/using-always-encrypted-php-drivers?view=sql-server-2017#limitations-of-the-php-drivers-when-using-always-encrypted)
[Known Issues]
- Connection pooling on Linux or macOS not recommended with [unixODBC](http://www.unixodbc.org/) &lt; 2.3.6
- When pooling is enabled in Linux or macOS
  - unixODBC &lt;= 2.3.4 (Linux and macOS) might not return proper diagnostics information, such as error messages, warnings and informative messages
  - due to this unixODBC bug, fetch large data (such as xml, binary) as streams as a workaround. See the examples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/wiki/Features#pooling)
- With ColumnEncryption enabled, calling stored procedure with XML parameter does not work (Issue [#674](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/674))</n>
