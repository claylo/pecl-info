 <n>* Corrected 64bit issues, long were used on too many places (#14517) thanks tony for the doc
* Corrected a segfault when quotes were not closed properly.
* Corrected errors given by scripts/dev/check_parameters.php. 
* Added quote escaping (BBCODE_ARG_QUOTE_ESCAPING).
* Changed behaviour when a tag as an unclosed quoted argument. 
  Before 1.0.2 it would stop treating datas, now the parser continues just after the opening quote character.
* Added an escaping test case</n>
