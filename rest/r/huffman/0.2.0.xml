 <s>Huffman compression is a lossless compression algorithm that is ideal for compressing textual data.</s>
 <d>Huffman compression belongs into a family of algorithms with a variable codeword length. That means that individual symbols (characters in a text file for instance) are replaced by bit sequences that have a distinct length. So symbols that occur a lot in a file are given a short sequence while other that are used seldom get a longer bit sequence.
