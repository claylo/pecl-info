 <s>igbinary extension</s>
 <d>Igbinary is a drop in replacement for the standard php serializer. Instead of
	time and space consuming textual representation, igbinary stores php data
	structures in a compact binary form. Savings are significant when using
	memcached or similar memory based storages for serialized data.</d>

 <n>* Use PHP's shared empty array instance when unserializing empty arrays in php 7.3+.
  (helps slightly with memory usage when repeatedly unserializing,
  when removing elements from arrays before unserializing them,
  or when serializing values including an empty array that was unserialized)
* Emit a deprecation notice when serializing resources.
  PHP itself is converting many resources to objects that throw an Error on serialization attempts.
  Continue to represent resources as null in the serialized data.
* Fix memory management bug when unserializing invalid data (duplicate properties in objects (e.g. from `__sleep`) or duplicate fields in arrays (impossible for valid data)).
* Speed up calls to `__serialize`/`__unserialize` in php 8.0+.
* Fix error messages for unserialize_callback_func: make messages properly refer to the autoload function.
* Optimize unserializing alternative names for private/protected constants that were previously public.</n>
