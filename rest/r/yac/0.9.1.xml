 <s>lockless user data cache</s>
 <d>yac is a shared memory user data cache for PHP.  it can be used to replace APC or local memcached.

  yac is lockless, that means, it is very fast, but there could be a chance you will get a wrong data(depends on how many key slots are allocated and how many keys are stored), so you'd better make sure that your product is not very sensitive to that.</d>
