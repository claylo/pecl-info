 <s>Troubleshoot application and server performance</s>
 <d>Graphdat is a real time performance monitoring tool for websites. Graphdat graphs system metrics along side request counts and response time data. The purpose of the extension is report request counts and response time information to our agent (installed on the box) which forwards that along to our servers. The data is then presented in a graph so that you can see performance spikes as they happen, and trends over time.</d>
