 <s>APCu - APC User Cache</s>
 <d>APC User Caching</d>
 <da>2025-12-07 08:01:05</da>
 <n>- Defragmentation now reclaims unused space from moved entries, resulting in better compaction.
- Shared memory for new entries is allocated faster in scenarios with many free memory blocks.
  This should improve APCu&#039;s insertion performance when entries are frequently deleted or
  replaced, or when APCu is used with larger amounts of memory.
- Trying to insert entries larger than the shared memory no longer results in cache wipes.
- Fix build against PHP 8.6.
- Fix apc.php compatibility with older apcu versions.</n>
