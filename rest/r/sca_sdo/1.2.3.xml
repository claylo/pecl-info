 <s>Service Component Architecture (SCA) and Service Data Objects (SDO) for PHP</s>
 <d>Service Data Objects (SDOs) enable PHP applications to work with data from different sources (typically a database query or an XML file) using a single interface. SCA for PHP allows a PHP programmer to write reusable components (classes) in PHP, which can be called either locally, or in a a variety of ways remotely (soap web services, xml-rpc, json-rpc, REST, etc), but always with the same interface.

   - TUSCANY-1564 - (which is PECL 11774) xsi:type not always set for complexType
