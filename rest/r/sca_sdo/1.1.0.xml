 <s>Service Component Architecture (SCA) and Service Data Objects (SDO) for PHP</s>
 <d>Service Data Objects (SDOs) enable PHP applications to work with data from different sources (like a database query, an XML file, or a spreadsheet) using a single interface. SCA for PHP allows a PHP programmer to write reusable components (classes) in PHP, which can be called either locally, or remotely via Web Services, with an identical interface.

 <n>This is the first release under the new project name SCA_SDO (renamed from SDO).
The rename reflects the fact that this project now implements the Service Component Architecture (SCA)
(see http://osoa.org/display/PHP/SCA+with+PHP for more information).
The project's stable state refers to the SDO component.
The SCA component is currently alpha quality and experimental.
The main changes since 1.0.4 are:
 - inclusion of the Service Component Architecture (SCA) component
 - new PEAR packaging to install SCA and SDO as peer directories (PEAR/SCA and PEAR/SDO)
 - update to Apache Tuscany C++ SDO revision level 478193
 - new function in SDO_DAS_Relational to support multiple root data objects
 - new function in SDO_DAS_XML to support CDATA sections (not yet complete)
 - fixes for bugs #9287, #9289, #9339</n>
