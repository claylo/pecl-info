 <n>First stable version of PDO_INFORMIX driver for PDO.
Note that on Windows, large objects (LOBs) are currently returned as long strings instead of streams.
Fixed issue where re-executing a statement would crash because column descriptors were being released at the wrong time.
Fixed the behavior of PDO transactions to comply with PDO spec.
Fixed bug where PDO::PARAM_LOB was not processed properly causing an exception when binding a string value to a varchar using PDO::PARAM_LOB
Fixed a bug which caused a crash when binding multiple stream based LOB parameters.
Fixed how text,binary,clob,blob fields are bound to columns.
Added feature to allow bound lob columns to return a stream.</n>
