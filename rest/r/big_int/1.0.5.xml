 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory
applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.

See /tests/RSA.php in the package for example of simple
implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.
See http://chat.finalcombat.com/vayala/big_int/ page for
more complex implementation of RSA-like crypto, which
supports key generating, encrypting/decrypting, signing
and validating of sign.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work
with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath
and consists almost all functions, which are implemented
in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.

 <n>* significantly improved speed of bi_to_str() function (up to 30 times for base = 2)
* fixed bug in big_int_to_str() function, which sometimes returned wrong result for negative numbers</n>
