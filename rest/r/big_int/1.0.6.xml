 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory
applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.

See /tests/RSA.php in the package for example of simple
implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.
See http://pear.php.net/packages/Crypt_RSA/ project for
more complex implementation of RSA-like crypto, which
supports key generating, encrypting/decrypting, generating
and validating of digital sign.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work
with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath
and consists almost all functions, which are implemented
in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.

 <n>+ added frequently requested function bi_is_one(), which compares number with 1
+ added php_big_int.dsw and php_big_int.dsp files. Now it is possible to build big_int extension on MSVC6
* updated documentation (/docs/index.html, INSTALL, README) and tests (/tests folder)
* significantly improved speed of bi_from_str() function (up to 30 times for base = 2)</n>
