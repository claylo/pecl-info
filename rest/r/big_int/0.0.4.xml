 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers</s>
 <d>This package is useful for number theory applications.
For example, in two-keys cryptography.
Ses tests/RSA.php in the package for example of implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.

Also the package has many bitset functions, which allow to work with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath.
It implements almost all functions as in GMP extension,
but it needn't any additional external libraries.
