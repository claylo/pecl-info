 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.
See /tests/RSA.php in the package for example of simple implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.
See contents of /PEAR folder for more complex implementation of RSA-like crypto, which supports key generating,
encrypting/decrypting, signing and validating of sign.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath and consists almost all functions, which 
are implemented in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.

 <n>+ added optional parameter to functions bi_or(), bi_and(), bi_xor() and bi_andnot(), which allows to set start position for bitwise operations. See /tests/bitset.php for details
+ added new function: bi_info(), which returns useful information, related to the package. See documentation for details
+ added flexible and extensible set of PHP classes, which allow to work with RSA-like two-key cryptography. See contents of /PEAR folder
+ updated documentation. Now it has pretty look. See /docs/index.html
+ added missing /tests/std_header.php and /test/rand.php scripts
+ updated BIG_INT library to new version
* fixed several bugs in /php_big_int.c</n>
