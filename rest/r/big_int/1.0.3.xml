 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory
applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.

See /tests/RSA.php in the package for example of simple
implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.
See http://chat.finalcombat.com/vayala/big_int/ page for
more complex implementation of RSA-like crypto, which
supports key generating, encrypting/decrypting, signing
and validating of sign.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work
with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath
and consists almost all functions, which are implemented
in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.

 <n>* fixed the bug in big_int_create() function, which does not actually return the big_int it created. Thanks to Paul Vincent Craven (paul at cravenfamily.com)
* fixed wrong include path in /tests/bitset.php
* fixed possible bug in bin_op() function in /libbig_int/src/bitset_funcs.c, when parameter [a] or [b] points to the same address as [answer]
- removed unnesessary /PEAR folder, which contained of Crypt_RSA package. This package is available at http://chat.finalcombat.com/valyala/big_int/ page.</n>
