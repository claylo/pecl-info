 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory
applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.

See /tests/RSA.php in the package for example of simple
implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.
See http://chat.finalcombat.com/vayala/big_int/ page for
more complex implementation of RSA-like crypto, which
supports key generating, encrypting/decrypting, signing
and validating of sign.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work
with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath
and consists almost all functions, which are implemented
in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.

 <n>* fixed bugs in php_big_int.vcproj and php_big_int.c, which fails package building under MSVC.NET.
+ fresh binaries of the package were uploaded on http://chat.finalcombat.com/valyala/big_int/ . It is available to download unix and windows binaries for PHP4.3.10, PHP4.3.11, PHP5.0.3 and PHP5.0.4.</n>
