 <s>big_int library provides a set of functions for calculations with arbitrary length integers and bitsets</s>
 <d>Functions from this package are useful for number theory applications. For example, in two-keys cryptography.
See tests/RSA.php in the package for example of implementation of RSA-like cryptoalgorithm.

The package has many bitset functions, which allow to work with arbitrary length bitsets.

This package is much faster than bundled into PHP BCMath and consists almost all functions, which 
implemented in PHP GMP extension, but it needn't any external libraries.</d>

 <n>+ first stable release
* fixed installation bug during execution of 'pear install big_int' command
- removed unnesessary files from package: regression tests and calc application, based on BIG_INT library.
  These files are still avaible at BIG_INT homepage http://chat.finalcombat.com/valyala/big_int/</n>
