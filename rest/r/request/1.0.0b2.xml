 <s>Provides server-side request and response objects.</s>
 <d>This extension provides server-side request and response objects for PHP 7.
These are *not* HTTP message objects proper. They are more like wrappers
for existing global PHP variables and functions, with some limited
additional convenience functionality.

This extension defines two classes in the global namespace:

- ServerRequest, composed of read-only copies of PHP superglobals and some
  other commonly-used values, with methods for adding application-specific
  request information in immutable fashion.

- ServerResponse, essentially a wrapper around (and buffer for) response-
  related PHP functions, with some additional convenience methods, and self-
  sending capability.

A PHP 5 userland implementation that tracks this extension is available at
https://packagist.org/packages/pmjones/request .</d>

- Support for multiple header callbacks, a la header_register_callback, with
  new methods ServerResponse::setHeaderCallbacks(), addHeaderCallback(), and
  getHeaderCallbacks().</n>
