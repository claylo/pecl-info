 <s>Polyfill of WeakMap/WeakReference for older PHP versions. This is a fork of the abandoned &quot;weakref&quot; PECL.</s>
 <d>A weak reference provides a gateway to an object without preventing that object from being collected by the garbage collector (GC).</d>
 <da>2022-01-06 03:03:05</da>
 <n>- Fork this from the abandoned &quot;weakref&quot; PECL to provide WeakMap for php 7.0-7.4 and WeakReference for php 7.0-7.3
- Fix compilation errors for WeakMap in php 7.4
- Rename WeakRef to WeakReference to act as a polyfill for WeakReference in php before php 7.4.
- Make WeakReference constructor throw and require the use of WeakReference::create, like php 7.4
- Fix edge cases when destructor of an old value modifies the weakmap during an update.
- Strictly prevent the creation of dynamic properties on a WeakReference.</n>
