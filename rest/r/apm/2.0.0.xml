 <s>Alternative PHP Monitor</s>
 <d>Monitoring extension for PHP, collects error events and statistics and send them to one of his drivers.
SQLite and MariaDB/MySQL drivers are storing those in a database.
StatsD driver sends them to StatsD using UDP.
Socket driver sends them via UDP or TCP socket using its dedicated protocol.
More drivers to come (SNMP, e-mail, Hadoop,...).</d>
 <da>2015-02-20 07:45:43</da>
 <n>New drivers:
- StatsD
- Socket

Added:
- Per-driver option 'apm.&lt;storage driver&gt;_store_silenced_events that lets you toggle whether to store silenced (@-ed) errors (thanks Mathieu Kooiman (@mathieuk))
- apm.*_exception_mode configuration to control exception collection
- Auto creation of SQLite and MariaDB/MySQL schemas
- Stats:
  - User and System CPU time
  - Memory Peak Usage
  - HTTP response code
- 'application_id' field to categorize the issues per application/server/environment/...
- Support for compilation on Ubuntu (thanks Olivier Garcia (@0livier))

Changed:
- Deep refactoring:
  - New DB schema
  - No more native functions, retrieval of data is directly made in PHP
- SQLite drivder attempts to create the directory structure by himself
- Renamed 'slow request' to 'stats'
- Connect to MySQL once and reconnect if needed
- Small UI improvements
- Avoiding int / uint conversion
- MariaDB/MySQL driver activated by default

Fixed:
- Parse error test failing on PHP 5.4
- Possible segfault with APM_DEBUG used outside RINIT/RSHUTDOWN phases
- Missing disconnect from SQLite DB if changed with ini_set()
- Too few arguments to sprintf() with MariaDB/MySQL backend
- Possible segfault with PHP 5.5
- Segmentation fault with &quot;zend_mm_heap corrupted&quot; message.
- Missing zval reference incrementing
- Out of memory error in backtrace generation
- Removed hard-coded limit of 64kB json data
- Do not activate silence handler if APM is not enabled
- Some compiler warnings
- Incorrect status propagation for PHP_RSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION
- Several memory leaks

Removed:
- Deffered processing (can't be easily implemented in a generic and driver
  agnostic way. Depending on the drivers, some deffered processing will
  happen inside them.)
- Reference SQL files, see source code for that ;-)</n>
