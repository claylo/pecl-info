 <s>A stats collection and distributed tracing framework</s>
 <d>OpenCensus is a open source, distributed tracing system that allows you to collect latency data and report it to any trace aggregation system such as Zipkin or Stackdriver Trace.

This extension allows you to easily gather latency and other metadata by watching for targeted function and method invocations without needing to inject code into the libraries.</d>
