 <s>Transliterates non-latin character sets to latin</s>
 <d>This extension allows you to transliterate text in non-latin characters (such
as Chinese, Cyrillic, Greek etc) to latin characters.  Besides the
transliteration the extension also contains filters to upper- and lowercase
latin, cyrillic and greek, and perform special forms of transliteration such
as converting ligatures such as the Norwegian &quot;Ã¦&quot; to &quot;ae&quot; and normalizing
punctuation and spacing.

 <n>Added support for diffent incoming and outgoing encodings to the
transliterator. This makes the extension depend on the iconv extension.  Added
a new function &quot;transliterate_filters_get()&quot; to return a list of all available
filters and added support for aliases of filters with the ALIAS pragma in the
.tr files. Also removed the special decomposition of the paragraph sign.</n>
