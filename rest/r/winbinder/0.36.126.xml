Changes in library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- &quot;plus&quot; string accepted as accelerator in menus or in wb_create_control($mainwin, Accel, ...)
- All styles that can be set with wb_set_style() can now be set on wb_create_control() too (but not vice-versa yet)
- Arrow keys will change pages of a tab control with the keyboard focus (Part of item #353)
- Edit controls send the WBC_KEYPRESS notification message when a key is pressed. lparam2 contains the key code
- Fixed function wb_set_style(), was broken
- Fixed inconsistency in WBC_DBLCLICK: was being tested in style instead of lparam (thanks Alexandre)
- Item #300 (resize toolbars automatically) - already implemented
- ListView: header selection goes now through WBC_HEADERSEL notification message in $lparam1; Header number is $lparam2. Thus WBC_HEADERSEL must be included as lparam in wb_create_window(). CAUTION: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE.
- Message WBC_HEADERSEL is sent to callback function when a ListView header is clicked
- More options in wb_wait(): WBC_MOUSEUP, WBC_KEYUP
- Moved the OOi interface to a separate file
- New aliases accepted as accelerators in menus or in wb_create_control($mainwin, Accel, ...): &quot;ESC&quot;, &quot;PGDN&quot;, &quot;PGUP&quot;, &quot;INS&quot;, &quot;DEL&quot;
- New constant WBC_KEYDOWN, used in wb_wait()
- New constant WBC_KEYUP, used in wb_wait()
- New constant: FTA_REGULAR (Same as FTA_NORMAL)
- New constant: WBC_HEADERSEL
- New function wb_wait() can be used as a simple delay or to verify if a key or mouse button was pressed, useful for lengthy operations
- New function: wb_draw_image() (Issue #138)
- New function: wb_draw_text()
- New function: wb_get_focus(), returns the control or window that has the focus
- New notification: WBC_KEYPRESS
- New wb_get_system_info() parameters (part of item #276):
	- &quot;commandline&quot;: The original Windows command line including the executable file (PHP.EXE)
	- &quot;consolemode&quot;: A boolean indicating whether console (DOS box) is active or not
	- &quot;computername&quot;: The name of the computer, in a network
	- &quot;username&quot;:  The name of the user, in a network
	- &quot;screenarea&quot;: The total area (x, y, width, height) of the screen, in pixels
	- &quot;workarea&quot;: The valid area (x, y, width, height) of the screen, in pixels
	- &quot;exepath&quot;: Path to the main executable (PHP.EXE)
	- &quot;systemfont&quot;: The default interface font, which will be used in the controls
- No need to include notification messages as lparam when creating a window
- Parameter linewidth works correctly in wb_draw_rect() now
- Solved bug #399, &quot;Menu access keys won't work in some apps&quot;
- Solved issue #299, &quot;Optional dotted lines in treeviews&quot;, using wb_set_style()
- Solved serious leakage in some wb_draw* functions
- Some resource leaks solved
- Tab control: tab selection goes now through WBC_HEADERSEL notification message in $lparam1; Tab number is $lparam2. Thus WBC_HEADERSEL must be included as lparam in wb_create_window(). CAUTION: THIS CHANGE MAY BREAK EXISTING CODE.
- wb_create_font() had undefined values for optional parameters, fixed
- wb_create_image(): two optional, extra parameters for use with image libraries (like FreeImage): bmi, bits
- wb_draw_text() can accept flags WBC_CENTER, WBC_LEFT, WBC_RIGHT, WBC_LINES, WBC_ELLIPSIS
- wb_draw_text() now accepts three different vertical alignments: new constants WBC_TOP, WBC_BOTTOM, WBC_MIDDLE
- wb_exec() will give a warning if the executable/target file does not exist
- wb_exec(): new 'o' parameter will &quot;shell execute&quot; a phpw file instead of running it. It will usually run it anyway, except if the user has changed the .phpw association.
- wb_exec(): new parameters 'c' or 'w' run a phpw file in console or windowed mode, respectively
- wb_poke(): an incorrect NULL test was improperly invalidating some results. Fixed.
- wb_send_message(): 0xFFFF (65535) can be used as first parameter (HWND_BROADCAST in Windows API)
- wb_set_style(): changed parameter to set/unset style (bool)
- wb_wait: changed parameter order, now flags is last
- Bug fix: wb_wait was always returning upon keyboard events regardless of flags: fixed.
