Flite was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is a small, fast run-time voice synthesis engine which is designed to run in embedded systems and/or large scale server deployments (aka memory/processor efficient). The PHP extension uses the Flite library to transform text strings into spoken audio via both RIFF and raw formatted wave files.
