This shouldn't normally need\n  to be called manually, but is available for unusual use cases.\n\nSalt encryption is generally achieved through the use of the new\nRADIUS_OPTION_SALT option. All put functions have been extended to accept an\noptional options bitfield and an optional tag value, which will be used to tag\nan attribute if the RADIUS_OPTION_TAGGED option is set.\n\nThere should be no backward compatibility breaks with this release; however\nexisting users are encouraged to test their code against this release and to\nreport any issues that they find.\n\nThe next beta is expected in around two weeks from today (approximately July\n18, 2013).",
