    "description": "This extension allows you to operate on an XML document with the DOM API.\n\nIt has been superseded by the DOM extension that ships with PHP 5.\n\nAlthough it should be possible to use this old domxml extension with PHP 5, its use is highly discouraged, as there a very high potential for conflicts with the new dom extension.\n\nIf you are migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5, the recommended best-practice is to port your domxml code to the much better dom code.\n\nIf you really must build domxml, you will need to obtain the sources from CVS and build them yourself.\n\nSee http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php for instructions.\n\nNOTE: if you're running PHP 4.x, the domxml is already part of the distribution.\n\nNOTE 2: The download link below \"Download latest\" is broken and doesn't lead to anything. Please read above carefully for how to get it, if you really need to.",
