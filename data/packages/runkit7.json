Security support for php 7.1 from php-src ended in December 2019\n  and runkit7 requires a lot of work to verify that changes or new features work correctly with the internals of php in all PHP versions.\n- Remove disabled code, constants, and ini settings related to the sandbox feature.\n  Runkit7 has never supported sandboxes or runkit_lint due to changes to internals in php7 making it impractical.\n- Remove runkit7_object_id() - PHP 7.2 adds spl_object_id() to do the same thing.\n- Fix build failure in php 8.0-dev - this extension's support for php 8 is still incomplete and experimental.\n- Add parameter default constant names to reflection (php 8 only).",
