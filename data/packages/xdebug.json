            "releaseNotes": "Wed, Nov 25, 2020 - xdebug 3.0.0\n\nXdebug 3 includes major changes in functionality compared to Xdebug 2. The\nprimary way how you turn on functionality is through the new xdebug.mode PHP\nconfiguration setting. This made it possible to massively increase performance\nin many of Xdebug's sub systems as Xdebug is now much more conservative in\nwhich hooks are enabled.\n\nConfiguration changes, massive performance improvements, and PHP 8 support are\nthe primary features in Xdebug 3, but there is much more. The upgrade guide\nlists the changes in great detail, please read it:\n\nhttps://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide\n\n-------------\n\n+ New features:\n\n  - Implemented issue #1762: Introduce feature modes\n  - Implemented issue #1793: Add xdebug.start_upon_error setting to cover the removed xdebug.remote_mode=jit feature.\n  - Implemented issue #1797: Implement generic logging\n  - Implemented issue #1801: Rename mode 'display' to mode 'develop'\n  - Implemented issue #1831: Add diagnostics function xdebug_info()\n  - Implemented issue #1833: Add links to documentation in diagnostic log\n  - Implemented issue #1837: Support for associative variadic variable names (PHP 8)\n  - Implemented issue #1841: Add support for PHP 8 'match' keyword\n\n+ Improvements:\n\n  - Implemented issue #1680: Update var dumping routines to include relevant information for interned strings and immutable arrays\n  - Implemented issue #1712: Add unit to profiler data types\n  - Implemented issue #1743: Figuring out whether a call is a closure uses string comparisions instead of checking the ACC flag (Benjamin Eberlei)\n  - Implemented issue #1752: Use a stack pool to manage stack entries instead of allocating and deallocating entries\n  - Implemented issue #1755: Overload pcntl_fork() to prevent performance degradation by calling xdebug_get_pid often (Carlos Granados)\n  -

            "releaseNotes": "Sun, Jan 03, 2010 - xdebug 2.1.0beta1\n\n+ Added features:\n\t- Added error display collection and suppressions.\n\t- Added the recording of headers being set in scripts.\n\t- Added variable assignment tracing.\n\t- Added the ability to turn of the default overriding of var_dump().\n\t- Added \"Scream\" support, which disables the @ operator.\n\t- Added a trace-file analysing script.\n\t- Added support for debugging into phars.\n\t- Added a default xdebug.ini. (Patch by Martin Schuhfu\n\t  <martins@spot-media.de>)\n\t- Added function parameters in computerized function traces.\n\t- PHP 5.3 compatibility.\n\t- Improved code coverage accuracy.\n\n  + New functions:\n\t- xdebug_get_formatted_function_stack(), which returns a formatted function\n\t  stack instead of displaying it.\n\t- xdebug_get_headers(), which returns all headers that have been set in a\n\t  script, both explicitly with things like header(), but also implicitly\n\t  for things like setcookie().\n\t- xdebug_start_error_collection(), xdebug_stop_error_collection() and\n\t  xdebug_get_collected_errors(), which allow you to collect all notices,\n\t  warnings and error messages that Xdebug generates from PHP's\n\t  error_reporting functionality so that you can output them at a later\n\t  point in your script by hand.\n\n  + New settings:\n\t- xdebug.collect_assignments, which enables the emitting of variable\n\t  assignments in function traces.\n\t- xdebug.file_line_format, to generate a link with a specific format for \n\t  every filename that Xdebug outputs.\n\t- xdebug.overload_var_dump, which allows you to turn off Xdebug's version\n\t  of var_dump().\n\t- xdebug.remote_cookie_expire_time, that controls the length of a\n\t  remote debugging session. (Patch by Rick Pannen <pannen@gmail.com>)\n\t- xdebug.scream, which makes the @ operator to be ignored.\n\n+ Changes:\n\t- Added return values for xdebug_start_code_coverage() and\n\t  xdebug_stop_code_coverage() to indicate whether the action was\n\t  succesfull.  xdebug_start_code_coverage() will return TRUE if the call\n\t  enabled code coverage, and FALSE if it was already enabled.\n\t  xdebug_stop_code_coverage() will return FALSE when code coverage wasn't\n\t  started yet and TRUE if it was turned on.\n\t- Added an optional argument to xdebug_print_function_stack() to display\n\t  your own message. (Patch by Mikko Koppanen).\n\t- All HTML output as generated by Xdebug now has a HTML \"class\" attribute\n\t  for easy CSS formatting.\n\n- Removed features:\n\t- Support for PHP versions lower than PHP 5.1 have been dropped.\n\t- The PHP3 and GDB debugger engines have been removed.\n\n= Fixed bugs:\n\t- Fixed support for showing $this in remote debugging sessions.\n\t- Fixed bug in formatting the display of \"Variables in the local scope\".\n\t- Possible fix for a threading issue where the headers gathering function\n\t  would create stack overflows.\n\t- Possible fix for #324: xdebug_dump_superglobals() only dumps superglobals\n\t  that were accessed before, and #478: XDebug 2.0.x can't use %R in\n\t  xdebug.profiler_output_name if register_long_arrays is off.\n\n\t- Fixed bug #505: %s in xdebug.trace_output_name breaks functions traces.\n\t- Fixed bug #494: Private attributes of parent class unavailable when\n\t  inheriting.\n\t- Fixed bug #486: feature_get -n breakpoint_types returns out of date list.\n\t- Fixed bug #476: Xdebug doesn't support PHP 5.3's exception chaining.\n\t- Fixed bug #472: Dead Code Analysis for code coverage messed up after goto.\n\t- Fixed bug #470: Catch blocks marked as dead code unless executed.\n\t- Fixed bug #469: context_get for function variables always appear as\n\t  \"uninitialized\".\n\t- Fixed bug #468: Property_get on $GLOBALS works only at top-level, by\n\t  adding GLOBALS to the super globals context.\n\t- Fixed bug #453: Memory leaks.\n\t- Fixed bug #445: error_prepend_string and error_append_string are ignored\n\t  by xdebug_error_cb. (Patch by Kent Davidson <kent@marketruler.com>)\n\t- Fixed bug #442: configure: error: \"you have strange libedit\".\n\t- Fixed bug #439: Xdebug crash in xdebug_header_handler.\n\t- Fixed bug #423: Conflicts with funcall.\n\t- Fixed bug #419: Make use of P_tmpdir if defined instead of hard coded\n\t  '/tmp'.\n\t- Fixed bug #417: Response of context_get may lack page and pagesize\n\t  attributes.\n\t- Fixed bug #411: Class/function breakpoint setting does not follow the\n\t  specs.\n\t- Fixed bug #393: eval returns array data at the previous page request.\n\t- Fixed bug #391: Xdebug doesn't stop executing script on catchable fatal\n\t  errors.\n\t- Fixed bug #389: Destructors called on fatal error.\n\t- Fixed bug #368: Xdebug's debugger bails out on a parse error with the\n\t  eval command.\n\t- Fixed bug #356: Temporary breakpoints persist.\n\t- Fixed bug #355: Function numbers in trace files weren't unique.\n\t- Fixed bug #340: Segfault while throwing an Exception.\n\t- Fixed bug #328: Private properties are incorrectly enumerated in case of\n\t  extended classes.\n\t- Fixed bug #249: Xdebug's error handler messes up with the SOAP\n\t  extension's error handler.\n\n+ DBGP:\n\t- Fixed cases where private properties where shown for objects, but not\n\t  accessible.\n\t- Added a patch by Lucas Nealan (lucas@php.net) and Brian Shire\n\t  (shire@php.net) of Facebook to allow connections to the initiating\n\t  request's IP address for remote debugging.\n\t- Added the -p argument to the eval command as well, pending inclusion into\n\t  DBGP.\n\t- Added the retrieval of a file's execution lines. I added a new\n\t  un-official method called xcmd_get_executable_lines which requires the\n\t  stack depth as argument (-d). You can only fetch this information for\n\t  stack frames as it needs an available op-array which is only available\n\t  when a function is executed.\n\t- Added a fake \"CLASSNAME\" property to objects that are returned in debug\n\t  requests to facilitate deficiencies in IDEs that fail to show the \"classname\"\n\t  XML attribute.",

Due to this change expected arguments that were not send to a\n\t  function will now show up as ??? in stack and function traces in PHP 5.1\n\t  and PHP 5.2.\n\t- Allow xdebug.var_display_max_data and xdebug.var_display_max_depth\n\t  settings of -1 which will unlimit those settings.\n\t- DBGP: Sort super globals in Globals overview.\n\t- DBGP: Fixed a bug where error messages where not added upon errors in the\n\t  protocol.\n\t- DBGP: Change context 1 from globals (superglobals + vars in bottom most\n\t  stack frame) to just superglobals.\n\n= Fixed bugs:\n\t- Fixed linking error on AIX by adding libm.\n\t- Fixed dead code analysis for THROW.\n\t- Fixed oparray prefill caching for code coverage.\n\t- Fixed the xdebug.remote_log feature work.\n\t- DBGP: Fixed a bug where $this did not appear in the local scoped context.\n\t- DBGP: Reimplemented property_set to use the same symbol fetching function\n\t  as property_get. We now only use eval in case no type (-t) argument was\n\t  given.\n\t- DBGP: Fixed some issues with finding out the classname, which is\n\t  important for fetching private properties.\n\t- DBGP: Fixed usage of uninitialized memory that prevented looking up\n\t  numerical array keys while fetching array elements not work properly.\n\t- Fixed bug #228: Binary safety for stream output and property fetches.\n\t- Fixed bug #227: The SESSION super global does not show up in the Globals\n\t  scope.\n\t- Fixed bug #225: xdebug dumps core when protocol is GDB.\n\t- Fixed bug #224: Compile failure on Solaris.\n\t- Fixed bug #219: Memory usage delta in traces don't work on PHP 5.2.0.\n\t- Fixed bug #215: Cannot retrieve nested arrays when the array key is a\n\t  numeric index.\n\t- Fixed bug #214: The depth level of arrays was incorrectly checked so it\n\t  would show the first page of a level too deep as well.\n\t- Fixed bug #213: Dead code analysis doesn't take catches for throws into\n\t  account.\n\t- Fixed bug #211: When starting a new session with a different idekey, the\n\t  cookie is not updated.\n\t- Fixed bug #209: Additional remote debugging session started when\n\t  triggering shutdown function.\n\t- Fixed bug #208: Socket connection attempted when XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP.\n\t- Fixed PECL bug #8989: Compile error with PHP 5 and GCC 2.95.",

            "releaseNotes": "+ Added new features:\n    - Implemented FR #70: Provide optional depth on xdebug_call_* functions.\n    - Partially implemented FR #50: Resource limiting for variable display. By\n      default only two levels of nested variables and max string lengths of 512\n      are shown. This can be changed by setting the ini settings\n      xdebug.var_display_max_depth and xdebug.var_display_max_data.\n    - Implemented breakpoints for different types of PHP errors. You can now\n      set an 'exception' breakpoint on \"Fatal error\", \"Warning\", \"Notice\" etc.\n      This is related to bug #187.\n    - Added the xdebug_print_function_trace() function to display a stack trace on\n      demand.\n    - Reintroduce HTML tracing by adding a new tracing option \"XDEBUG_TRACE_HTML\"\n      (4).\n    - Made xdebug_stop_trace() return the trace file name, so that the\n      following works: \n    - Added the xdebug.collect_vars setting to tell Xdebug to collect\n      information about which variables are used in a scope. Now you don't need\n      to show variables with xdebug.show_local_vars anymore for\n      xdebug_get_declared_vars() to work.\n    - Make the filename parameter to the xdebug_start_trace() function\n      optional. If left empty it will use the same algorithm to pick a filename\n      as when you are using the xdebug.auto_trace setting.\n\n+ Changes:\n    - Implemented dead code analysis during code coverage for:\n      * abstract methods.\n      * dead code after return, throw and exit.\n      * implicit returns when a normal return is present.\n    - Improved readability of stack traces.\n    - Use PG(html_errors) instead of checking whether we run with CLI when\n      deciding when to use HTML messages or plain text messages.\n\n= Fixed bugs:\n    - Fixed bug #203: PHP errors with HTML content processed incorrectly. This\n      patch backs out the change that was made to fix bug #182.\n    - Fixed bug #198: Segfault when trying to use a non-existing debug handler.\n    - Fixed bug #197: Race condition fixes created too many files.\n    - Fixed bug #196: Profile timing on Windows does not work.\n    - Fixed bug #195: CLI Error after debugging session.\n    - Fixed bug #193: Compile problems with PHP 5.2.\n    - Fixed bug #191: File/line breakpoints are case-sensitive on Windows.\n    - Fixed bug #181: Xdebug doesn't handle uncaught exception output\n      correctly.\n    - Fixed bug #173: Coverage produces wrong coverage.\n    - Fixed a typo that prevented the XDEBUG_CONFIG option \"profiler_enable\"\n      from working.",

This can also be set through\n      the \"remote_log\" element in the XDEBUG_CONFIG environment variable.\n    - Added a \"script\" value to the profiler_output_name option.

This\n\t  allows an IDE to emulate CGI and still pass the configuration through to\n\t  the debugger.  In CGI mode, PHP does not allow -d arguments.\n\t- Reimplementation of the tracing code, you can now only trace to file; this greatly\n\t  enhances performance as no string representation of variables need to be\n\t  kept in memory any more.\n\t- Re-implemented profiling support. Xdebug outputs information the same way\n\t  that cachegrind does so it is possible to use Kcachegrind as front-end.\n\t- Xdebug emits warnings when it was not loaded as a Zend extension.\n\t- Added showing private, protected and public to the fancy var_dump()\n\t  replacement function.\n\t- Added the setting of the TCP_NODELAY socket option to stop delays in\n\t  transferring data to the remote debugger client. (Patch by Christof J.  Reetz)\n\t+ DebugClient: Added setting for port to listen on and implemented running\n\t  the previous command when pressing just enter.\n\n+ Added new functions:\n\t- xdebug_get_stack_depth() to return the current stack depth level.\n\t- xdebug_get_tracefile_name() to retrieve the name of the tracefile. This\n\t  is useful in case auto trace is enabled and you want to clean the trace\n\t  file.\n\t- xdebug_peak_memory_usage() which returns the peak memory\n\t  used in a script. (Only works when --enable-memory-limit was enabled)\n\n+ Added feature requests:\n\t- FR #5: xdebug_break() function which interupts the script for the debug\n\t  engine.\n\t- FR #30: Dump current scope information in stack traces on error.\n\t- FR #88: Make the url parameter XDEBUG_SESSION_START optional. So it can\n\t  be disabled and the user does not need to add it.\n\n+ Added new php.ini settings:\n\t- xdebug.auto_trace_file: to configure a trace file to write to as addition\n\t  to the xdebug.auto_trace setting which just turns on tracing.\n\t- xdebug.collect_includes: separates collecting\n\t  names of include files from the xdebug.collect_params setting.\n\t- xdebug.collect_return: showing return values in traces.\n\t- xdebug.dump_global: with which you can turn off dumping of super globals\n\t  even in you have that configured.\n\t- xdebug.extended_info: turns off the generation of extended opcodes that\n\t  are needed for stepping and breakpoints for the remote debugger. This is\n\t  useful incase you want to profile memory usage as the generation of this\n\t  extended info increases memory usage of oparrrays by about 33%. \n\t- xdebug.profiler_output_dir: profiler output directory.\n\t- xdebug.profiler_enable: enable the profiler.\n\t- xdebug.show_local_vars: turn off the showing of local variables in the\n\t  top most stack frame on errors.\n\t- xdebug.show_mem_delta: show differences between current and previous\n\t  memory usage on a function call level.\n\t- xdebug.trace_options: to configure extra\n\t  options for trace dumping:\n\t\to XDEBUG_TRACE_APPEND option (1)\n\n= Changed features:\n\t- xdebug_start_trace() now returns the filename of the tracefile (.xt is\n\t  added to the requested name).\n\t- Changed default debugging protocol to dbgp instead of gdb.\n\t- Changed default debugger port from 17869 to 9000.\n\t- Changed trace file naming: xdebug.trace_output_dir is now used to\n\t  configure a directory to dump automatic traces; the trace file name now\n\t  also includes the pid (xdebug.trace_output_name=pid) or a crc32 checksum\n\t  of the current working dir (xdebug.trace_output_name=crc32) and traces\n\t  are not being appended to an existing file anymore, but simply\n\t  overwritten.\n\t- Removed $this and $GLOBALS from showing variables in the local scope.\n\n- Removed functions:\n\t- xdebug_get_function_trace/xdebug_dump_function_trace() because of the new\n\t  idea of tracing.\n\n= Fixed bugs:\n\t- Fixed bug #89: var_dump shows empty strings garbled.\n\t- Fixed bug #85: Xdebug segfaults when no idekey is set.\n\t- Fixed bug #83: More than 32 parameters functions make xdebug crash.\n\t- Fixed bug #75: xdebug's var_dump implementation is not binary safe.\n\t- Fixed bug #73: komodo beta 4.3.7 crash.\n\t- Fixed bug #72: breakpoint_get returns wrong structure.\n\t- Fixed bug #69: Integer overflow in cachegrind summary.\n\t- Fixed bug #67: Filenames in Xdebug break URI RFC with spaces.\n\t- Fixed bug #64: Missing include of xdebug_compat.h.\n\t- Fixed bug #57: Crash with overloading functions.\n\t- Fixed bug #54: source command did not except missing -f parameter.\n\t- Fixed bug #53: Feature get misusing the supported attribute.\n\t- Fixed bug #51: Only start a debug session if XDEBUG_SESSION_START is\n\t  passed as GET or POST parameter, or the DBGP_COOKIE is send to the server.\n\t  Passing XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP as GET/POST parameter will end the debug\n\t  session and removes the cookie again.

(Ilia)\n= Fixed bug #31: & entity replaced after others, wrong HTML output.\n  (Derick)\n= Fixed bug #27: Repeated connect attempts when no debugger is listening.\n  (Derick)\n= Fixed bug #22: Segmentation fault with xdebug_get_function_stack() and\n  collect_params=1. (Derick)\n= Fixed bug #19: The value of xdebug.output_dir in a .htaccess never takes\n  effect. (Derick)\n= Fixed bug #18: Mistyped sizeof()'s for array indexes in profiler output.\n  (Derick)\n= Fixed handling stack traces for when display_errors was set to Off. (Derick)\n= Fixed segfault where a function name didn't exist in case of a\n \"call_user_function\". (Derick)\n= Fixed reading a filename in case of an callback to a PHP function from an\n  internal function (like \"array_map()\"). (Derick)\n= Fixed bug with wrong file names for functions called from call_user_*().\n  (Derick)\n+ Added the option \"dump_superglobals\" to the remote debugger. If you set this\n  option to 0 the \"show-local\" and similar commands will not return any data\n  from superglobals anymore. (Derick)\n= Fixed bug #2: \"pear package\" triggers a segfault. (Derick)\n= Fixed crash bug when a function had sprintf style parameters (ie.\n  strftime()). (Derick)\n+ Added \"id\" attribute to <var /> elements in responses from the remove\n  debugger when the response method is XML. This makes it possible to\n  distinguish between unique elements by use of recursion for example. (Derick)\n= Improved performance greatly by doing lazy folding of variables outside\n  trace mode. (Derick)\n= Fixed a bug with \"quit\", if it was used it disabled the extension for the\n  current process. (Derick)\n+ Added the \"full\" argument to the remote command \"backtrace\". When this\n  argument is passed, the local variables will be returned to for each frame in\n  the stack. (Derick)\n+ Implemented xdebug_time_index() which returns the time passed since the\n  start of the script. This change also changes the output of the tracing\n  functions as the start time will no longer be the first function call, but\n  the real start time of the script. (Derick)\n+ Implemented the \"show-local\" command (shows all local variables in the\n  current scope including all contents). (Derick)\n+ Implemented conditions for breakpoints in the \"break\" command. (Derick)",
