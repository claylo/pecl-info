This also \n  completely fixes issue #34, testing may be needed.\n* Updated README_MSW adding changes needed to prevent windows xp \n  crashes as described on issue #37.\n* Enabled wxNonOwnedWindow::SetShape and fixed wxPrintDialog, \n  wxPageSetupDialog inheritage.\n* Removed error messages that appeared when failing to call \n  wxApp::OnInit and wxApp:OnExit.\n* Added proper type casting to wxMouseState.\n* Should fix and close #44 by doing proper type casting when calling \n  wxKeyboarState methods from child classes.\n* Binded the missing wxAuiNotebookEvent event constants which closes #45.\n* Enabled more wxStyledTextCtrl methods. \n* Enabled inheritance of wxStyledTextCtrl from wxTextEntry as \n  enabled some more methods.\n* Some fixes to the reference and interface generator as \n  simplification of chdir() calls.\n* Initial work to support wxInputStream::OnSysRead in order to be \n  able to load images with the wxImage(wxInputStream) constructor.\n* Fixed 2 memory leaks, one related to wxEvtHandler::OnEvent and the \n  other related to the creation of new objects.\n* Fixed memory leak caused by not uninitializing the properties \n  member of classes like wxPoint when they were destroyed which \n  closes #48, also modified code generator to only add the properties \n  code when needed which made the source and library more clean.",
