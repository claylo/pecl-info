    "description": "LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack) is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. This PHP extension makes use of the LAPACKE C bindings to LAPACK, and provides access to some of the 'driver' methods, allowing straightforward solving of linear algebra problems from PHP.",
