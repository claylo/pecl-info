    "description": "CHDB (constant hash database) is a fast key-value database for constant data,\nrealized by using a memory-mapped file and thus providing the following\nfunctionalities:\n - Extremely fast initial load, regardless of the size of the database.\n - Only the pages of the file which are actually used are loaded from the disk.\n - Once a page is loaded it is shared across multiple processes.\n - Loaded pages are cached across multiple requests and even process recycling.\nA typical use of CHDB is as a faster alternative to defining many PHP\nconstants.\nCHDB is internally implemented as a hash-table using a perfect hashing function,\nthus guaranteeing worst case O(1) lookup time.",
