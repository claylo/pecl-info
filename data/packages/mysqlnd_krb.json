    "description": "The mysqlnd_krb extension is an authentication \nplugin for mysqlnd that enables connections to MySQL accounts\nthat use Kerberos authentication.\n\nIf a MySQL account is configured with Kerberos authentication\n(using `IDENTIFIED WITH kerberos_authentication` clause\nof `CREATE USER`, see [1]) then normally `mysqlnd` will not\nbe able to connect to such an account. With this plugin such\nconnections are possible provided that user has appropriate\ntickets loaded into the Kerberos ticket cache (in this case\nno password is needed in the connection data).\n\nIf a ticket for the MySQL service is not present in the cache\nthe plugin can fetch the required ticket from Kerberos provided\nthat user principal's password is given in the connection data.\n\n[1] https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/kerberos-pluggable-authentication.html",
