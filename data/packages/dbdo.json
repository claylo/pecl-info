    "description": "DEAD - I'm not working on this, - currently PEAR::DB_DataObjects does all I need, so there is no motivation to carry on with it.\n\n\nDBDO performs 2 tasks:\n1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.\n2. acts as a datastore for a table row. (ORM)\nThe core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so \nthat you put the data logic inside the data classes.\n\nFor the most part, refer to this for documentation\nhttp://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db-dataobject.php\nand the project home page for any changes in method names.\n \nThe key differences between DataObjects and DBDO are:\n- PHP5 only\n- query() / with no arguments replaces find()\n- assignFrom replaces setFrom\n- DBDO::factory('dbalias','table') has 2 arguments, first being the db alias\n- Configuration done using static methods.\n  DBDO::config('dbalias', 'provider','Mysql');\n  DBDO::config('dbalias', 'cnc','database=XYZ');\n- Addition of FetchAll\n  $do->fetchAll(DBDO::SINGLE | DBDO::OBJECTS | DBDO::KEY_VALUE | DBDO::VALUE) \n- Error handling \n * Throws exceptions for database errors / unusual stuff\n * E_ERROR's and dies if you use it incorrectly (eg. fixable at code level)\n- No support for joins yet.. (On the TODO list) \n\nBuilding it Requires libgda (www.gnome-db.org), currently from CVS, which can be a pain.\n\n- Win32 support is theoretically possible, it just requires someone to spend time working\nout how to build libgda (which has windows makefiles) and this library.",
