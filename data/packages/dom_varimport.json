    "description": "The extension converts nested PHP arrays and objects into DOMDocument.\n  Some of projects use XSLT as a templating engine. To build XML for such engines,\n  we need a very fast and memory efficient way to convert PHP nested arrays and\n  objects into DOMDocument object. Also, produced XML should be straight-forward\n  and as simple as it could be (BTW XMLRPC, SOAP and other XML-based formats are quite\n  sloppy in this case). So dom_varimport has been introduced: it produces DOMDocument\n  from a nested array near 20 times faster than a hand-made code in native PHP\n  (1 MB XML with thousands of nodes could be generated in 1-2 ms).",
