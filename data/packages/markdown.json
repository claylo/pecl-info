    "description": "Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber. It is also\nthe name of the original tool written in Perl that converts such markup into\nHTML.\n\nThis library is a wrapper for a modified version of the discount Markdown\nprocessor, created by David Parsons. It supports several extensions of the\noriginal Markdown language, including smartypants-style substitutions, pandoc-\nstyle document headers, and parts of Markdown Extra.\n\nThe modifications to discount include discarding several parts important only\nto stand-alone applications that accompany the library code, better consistency\nin library interface functions, thread-safety without eager initialization of\nglobals, usage of the Zend memory manager and support for Microsoft Windows.\n\nDiscount is available at &lt;http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/>.\n\nThe page of the original Markdown is available at\n&lt;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>.\n\nWindows binaries (VC 9, x86, 1.0.0), with PDB files:<ul><li><a href=\"http://nebm.ist.utl.pt/~glopes/discount/windows/php_discount-1.0.0-5.4-nts-vc9-x86.zip\">PHP 5.4, no ZTS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nebm.ist.utl.pt/~glopes/discount/windows/php_discount-1.0.0-5.4-ts-vc9-x86.zip\">PHP 5.4, ZTS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nebm.ist.utl.pt/~glopes/discount/windows/php_discount-1.0.0-5.3-nts-vc9-x86.zip\">PHP 5.3, no ZTS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://nebm.ist.utl.pt/~glopes/discount/windows/php_discount-1.0.0-5.3-ts-vc9-x86.zip\">PHP 5.3, ZTS</a></li></ul>\nThis extension is also compatible with PHP 5.2, but no Windows binaries will be provided here.",
